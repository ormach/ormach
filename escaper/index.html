        <!-- Traits -->
        <section>
            <h3>Traits</h3>
            <p>
                Characters gain traits based on what they do in the game. 
            </p>
            <p class="example">
                PC: Attempts to sneak behind a guard, rolls action dice and succeeds.<br>
                GM: Grants PC a permanent +1 stealth trait.
            </p>

            <p>
                Player can unlock a random passive trait bonus by paying 5 trait points. Passive trait bonus will provide effect related to the trait.
            </p>

            <p class="example">
                Crafting Master: 25% chance to recover one crafting ingredient.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- States -->
        <section>
            <h3>States</h3>
            <p>
                Character can get any kind of states in the world based on their actions and conditions. If for example character works a lot without any rest, the character will gain "Tired" state that may negatively affect their rolls.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Some negative states can be removed via resting, eating etc. States progress over time if not removed causing more severe negative effects.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                Tired x1: Reduce your die roll values per each "Tired" stack.<br>
                Silence: Can‚Äôt cast spells or use magic scrolls.<br>
                Stun: Can‚Äôt act.
            </div>
            <p>
                Player may get temporary buffs or magic effects during the game. All effects of that type (magic buffs, consumable buffs, story related buffs) are removed at the end of the combat.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                If you gained 5 power during combat, when the combat will end, gained power is lost.
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Actions -->
        <section>
        <h3>Actions</h3>
        <p>
            There are two types of action. Item actions and improvised action.
            <br><br>

            Item actions ‚Äî provided by an item.

            Improvised actions ‚Äî role play actions.
                //Require skill check
        </p>

        <h3>Improvised actions</h3>
        <p>
            Players can choose to perform a custom action that is not provided by items at any time if conditions are appropriate. To do so, player should describe what they are trying to do in detail, then GM will evaluate the success threshold and player will roll the dice that will determine the outcome.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            GM: You are ambushed by a demon.<br>
            PC: Instead of attacking, I will use an improvised action, and will try to throw the grappling hook into the tower window and escape the attack.<br>
            GM: Roll d20, you need 15 to succeed. Your agility trait value is added to this roll...<br>

            In this example player chose to escape the encounter via improvised action.
        </div>

        <h3>Out of combat actions</h3>
        <p>
            Outcome of certain activities is determined by the die roll. Players roll d20 to determine if intended action was successful. Before the roll DM evaluates the action complexity and sets the success threshold.
        </p>

        <!-- Modules -->
        <section>
            <h3>Spirits (Experimental)</h3>
            <p>
                When character dies it's soul leaves the body and stays with the party as a spirit that can communicate with others, can't interact with physical world. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Spirit can be used to reanimate an undead, mech etc. Player in control of a spirit gains control over the reanimated character. Reanimated characters have special passives.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                Undead: -1 to everything.
            </div>
