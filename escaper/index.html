        <!-- Classes -->
        <section>
        <h3>CLASSES</h3>
            <p>
                No preset classes. Character class is shaped by their traits gained based on how they act.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Traits -->
        <section>
            <h3>TRAITS</h3>
            <p>
                If character performs an action GM may provide that character a trait. Traits permanently increase skill check rolls for the related action group. 
            </p>
            <p class="example">
                <span>PL:</span> Attempts to lift a boulder.<br>
                <span>GM:</span> Calls for a d20 skill check.<br>
                <span>PL:</span> Rolls a 20, succeeds.<br>
                <span>GM:</span> Awards "Strength: +3” trait.<br><br>

                <span>PL:</span> Later tries to throw a boulder at a druid. Rolls d20 and adds +3 from Strength.<br>
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- trait passives -->
        <section>
            <h3>TRAIT PASSIVES</h3>
            <p>
                Player can pay 5 trait points to unlock a random trait passive that will permanently provide a powerful passive effect to the character.
            </p>

            <p class="example">
                <span>Chains of Ash II:</span> During the night lesser undead obey your orders.<br>
                <span>Arcane Bastion:</span> Get no damage bonus from power. Swap power and defense.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- States -->
        <section>
            <h3>STATES</h3>
            <p>
                States represent effects that affect character due to environment or their actions. For example working a lot, or getting poisoned will apply a state that will apply a particular condition to the character.
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <span>Drunk:</span> Traits values are inverted.<br>
                <span>Brain damage:</span> Can't use words longer than 5 characters.<br>
            </div>

            <p>
                Temporary gains of power or defense from items, skills, or consumables are also considered a state, such effects are lost at the end of the any combat.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Actions -->
        <section>
        <h3>ACTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            Actions are ways for players to act in the game world. There are two types of action. Item actions and improvised action.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Predefined actions — Actions provided by items, skills learned by character, or trait passives.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improvised actions — Free form action performed by player describing what their character does in the game world. If required, GM will evaluate the success threshold, and player will roll d20 to determine the outcome.

                <div class="example">
                    <span>Game master:</span> You are ambushed by a demon.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Player:</span> Instead of attacking, I will use an improvised action, and will try to throw the grappling hook into the tower window and escape the attack.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Game master:</span> Roll d20, you need 15 to succeed. Your agility trait value is added to this roll...
                    
                    <br><br>
                    In this example player chose to escape the encounter via improvised action.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Items -->
        <section>
        <h3>ITEMS</h3>
        <p>
            Items can be carried by players to gain extra abilities in the game world. Here are the most common item types:
            <ul>
                <li>Combat items — Weapons, off-hands that provide actions intended to be used during combat.</li>
                <p class="example">
                    <span>Long bow:</span> Attack for 2d6 damage.
                </p>
                <li>Equipment — Items that provide passive effects when equipped.</li>
                <p class="example">
                    <span>Plate armor:</span> Cap incoming damage at 5. Stealth trait: -4.
                </p>
                <li>Consumables — Items that you consume to perform a specific action at any stage of the game. On use the item is destroyed.</li>
                <p class="example">
                    <span>Coffee leafs x1:</span> Increase your next die roll by d8 (extra action).
                </p>
            </ul>
        </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Combat -->
        <section>
        <h3>COMBAT</h3>
        <p>
            Combat in Escaper aims to be quick and meaningful. Here are the key aspects of the system: 
            
            <ul>
                <li>Quick — No more than 1-2 turns per encounter, if during that time none of the parties won, enemy will try to escape.</li>
                <li>Synchronous turn-based — Opposing party actions are resolved simultaneously to reduce the number of posts per encounter. During their turns characters can perform one main action (predefined or improvised), and multiple extra actions (mainly provided by consumable items).</li>
                <li>Reactive — Game master lists enemy intent at the start of each combat turn, players have to respond to enemies with their actions.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        </section>



        <!-- Modules -->
        <section>
            <h3>SPIRITS (Experimental)</h3>
            <p>
                When character dies it's soul leaves the body and stays with the party as a spirit that can communicate with others, can't interact with physical world. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Spirit can be used to reanimate an undead, mech etc. Player in control of a spirit gains control over the reanimated character. Reanimated characters have special passives.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                Lesser undead: -1 to everything.
            </div>
        </section>
